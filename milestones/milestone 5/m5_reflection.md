Milestone 5 - CS 211
Autumn Ossello

This milestone was made particularly difficult once again due to technological
limits and annoyances. I wasn’t able to start it for awhile due to issues with vLab
and then a fried malfunctioning laptop. Ultimately I was able to install the needed
programs on a parent’s work computer nearby and work on the project at that
office. Although that took most of my allotted time working out, I was able to
reach out to fellow students and get some much needed guidance to finish the
project more quickly. Understanding the given algorithm and how to apply it to my
code was the next hurdle. The biggest problem overall for me was the time constraint, the 
struggles of making technology work and dealing with insufficient internet speed 
and data limits made an otherwise straightforward project the most stressful 
two weeks of my semester so far. This was particularly true since many other 
projects and applications are due this weekend as well.

I feel as though I did as much as I could completing this project given the barriers
I faced. I feel like I had a good understanding of what the code is doing, and the
algorithm behind it. Near the end of yesterday I had working code that didn't contain
errors but also didn't seem to be finding any paths. I found out that I wasn't
correctly adding the new paths to the queue or assigning them to the returned path.
Then I ran into a series of null errors I realized were due to attempting paths
outside of the tile map, so I put in a null check to avoid moving off the map.
Lastly I realized my method for finding the endpoint was redundent so I fixed that
and commented out the unnecessary code. The little time I had to work on this project
was stressful but also still rewarding, and I feel as though I did accomplish my goals
by the end.

This COVID situation as a whole has been a test of endurance for me, with 
eroding technology and a sudden new environment I’ve found myself struggling to 
keep working at the same standards that I’ve maintained in the past. In addition to 
personal struggles that were present before these new developments, 2020 so far 
has really not been my year. I hope that moving into the next milestone, having 
finally acquired a computer that I can use for this class, I will be able to use the 
same skills I have in previous milestones and achieve something I can be proud 
of.
